## Introduction

This doc provides a list of features in Tekton Chains that are
being deprecated.

Deprecations will follow this timeline:
- Deprecation announcement is made during a release
- Feature is removed two releases later

So, if a feature is deprecated at v0.1.0, then it would be removed in v0.3.0.
